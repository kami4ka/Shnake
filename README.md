# Shnake - PoC for Monero in-game mining (Coinhive)

Shnake is proof-of-concept and a very hacky realisation of Snake game.

## How it's look?

Shnake can be fully customized, but I prefer to use old-school rectangle style.

## Rules

* Each food have random generated nutritional value (energy).<br>
* No new food will be generated until old not fully eaten and digested. <br>
* Speed of the Shnake will be increased during the food digestion. :scream: <br>
* The assimilation speed of food depends on the speed of resolving the Monero hashes. <br>


## How can I try this incredible thing?
